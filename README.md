# Ising-Model-Phases-Classifier-FNN
This statistical mechanics model aims to classify phases of the 2D Ising Model using a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) built from scratch without using any machine learning libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow. The FNN was trained on spin configurations from the 2D Ising model data provided by [Min Long](https://github.com/DavidGoing).

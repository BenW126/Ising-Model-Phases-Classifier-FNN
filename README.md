# Ising-Model-Phases-Classifier-FNN
This statistical mechanics model aims to classify phases of the 2-dimensional (2D) Ising Model using a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) built from scratch without using machine learning libraries like PyTorch or TensorFlow. The FNN was trained on spin configurations from the 2D Ising model data provided by [Min Long](https://github.com/DavidGoing).

For more information about the 2D Ising Model, here is the reference from Stanford University: http://micro.stanford.edu/~caiwei/me334/Chap12_Ising_Model_v04.pdf. This document covers the definition of the Ising model, solving the 1D Ising model, and the 2D Ising model, including its analytic solution, Monte Carlo simulation, and qualitative behavior.

# Ising-Model-Phases-Classifier-FNN
A statistical mechanics model aims to classify phases of the 2D Ising Model using a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) trained on spin configurations. The 2D Ising spin configuration data used in this model was provided by [Min Long](https://github.com/DavidGoing).
